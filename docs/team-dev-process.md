### Start of Team Proposal (Due: October 21, 2025)
---
- **Where are we?** We have started brainstorming for our app called Whispering Pages. We have started the wiki pages, had our first meeting, started our app with the README.md, and gotten some ideas for what we want included in the app.

- **Where are we going?** We want to build a user-friendly app that solves the issue of not being able to have all of your books in one place, no matter where you may be! In this, we have started our proposal for the app. Soon, we will begin implementing and testing this app.

- **How do we work together?** So far, we have been communicating what we each are doing by text message and assigning ourselves to steps in GitHub projects as assignees. This helps everyone give the group a chance to work on a part, while also seeing what others have done and what needs to be done. If we have any issues within the team, we can have a talk to be able to work them through, whether is it a conflict or disagreement. Although, we can adapt to whatever the issue may need in order to resolve it effectively.
